## P3

This Repository is just the web application part of the project.
P3 is an idea my team and I came up with at The LAHackaton in Novemeber 2018. 
Heres a link to the in <a href="https://github.com/victorjckim/hackathon-incar">Car App</a>


P3 is written in JavaScript running on GM's Next Generation Infotainment Emulator using APIs from both GM and VISA, we have developed both an in-car app as well as a mobile app. The in-car app allows the driver to search for all parking meters around the destination, providing information such as occupancy, rate per hour, etc. The mobile app allows the user to skip the interaction with the parking meter, and to complete the transaction with the touch of a few buttons. P3 was created so that we could help reduce traffic in LA.
